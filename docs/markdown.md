# Marpit Markdown

## How to write slides?

Marpit splits pages of the slide deck by horizontal ruler (e.g. `---`). It's very simple.

```markdown
# Slide 1

foo

---

# Slide 2

bar
```

?> By the spec of [CommonMark](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.28/#example-28), an empty line may be required before the hyphen ruler. You can use the underline ruler `___`, asterisk ruler `***`, and space-included ruler `- - -` when you not want to add empty lines.
